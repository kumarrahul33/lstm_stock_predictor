# lstm_stock_predictor

The model is trained on S&P500 Dataset ad NIFTY50 Dataset. We use LSTM to identify the trends based on various technical and fundamental indicators.
Using this trained model, we simulate experiments using an RL agent to try and earn profit.

Results show that while the model doesn't exactly capture the correct market values, it is able to capture a similar market trend (bullish, bearish). Further refining the model may provide insights into predicting the market movements.
